## Testing 

Unit tests are in place to make testing these API routes easier.

These unit tests should work regardless of your language if your server runs on the correct URL. Before running these tests please make sure you have [node](https://github.com/promethean-tech/rest-api-comparison/tree/main/node#prerequisites) installed on your local machine 

To run these unit tests:

- start your local server at localhost8000

```bash
cd tests
npm install
npm run test
```
- Please note that even if you don't have the server running, at least 1 unit test should pass ensuring that you have the tests folder configured/installed properly.
