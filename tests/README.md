## Testing 

Unit tests are in place to make testing these API routes easier.

To run these unit tests, run your local server at localhost8000

```bash
cd tests
npm install
npm run test
```
- Please note that even if you don't have the server running, at least 1 unit test should pass ensuring that you have the tests folder configured/installed properly.
