## Testing 

A testing folder is in place that will test all three of these basic API routes. Before creating your PR please make sure all of the unit tests pass.

To run these unit tests, run your local server at localhost8000

```bash
cd tests
npm install
npm run test
```
- Please note that even if you don't have the server running, at least 1 unit test should pass ensuring that you have the tests folder configured/installed properly.
