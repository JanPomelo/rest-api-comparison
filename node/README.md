# Learning Node.js REST API Project

This is a basic Node.js project created for learning purposes. The project focuses on making REST API calls and implementing middleware for a simple web application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

Download with the exe on the [node website](https://nodejs.org/en)

or

Use [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to get a more specific version of node.


Check if node is installed in your terminal before proceeding:

``
node --version
``

### Installation/Running

```bash
clone or folk the repo...
cd node
npm install
npm run dev
```
### Learning Objectives

* Make basic RESP APIs using Express
* Understand middleware and check auth before allowing people to access the endpoint
* I recommend, reading [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/organizing-express-js-project-structure-better-productivity/) about the Node and Express file structure. It is important to keep these rules in mind when creating larger projects. 

#### Summary

In short, this project is not for Typescript developers. This project is for node developers to start learning the basics of Golang.
